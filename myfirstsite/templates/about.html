    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p class="intro">
        Hi, I&apos;m <strong>Hamza</strong> — a Full-Stack Developer focused on building
        practical, scalable web applications.
    </p>

    <p>
        My primary experience is with <strong>Next.js</strong> and modern JavaScript ecosystems.
        I have also worked with <strong>Django</strong> for backend development and enjoy
        understanding how systems work end-to-end — from UI to database.
